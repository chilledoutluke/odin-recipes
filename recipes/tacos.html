        <h2>Slow Cooker Pulled Chicken Tacos</h2>
            <p>Tacos always keep the family running home for dinner. Here's a new take on classic pulled chicken tacos made with chicken thighs, a hint of sweet orange, tangy lime, and savory soy sauce. There's minimal chopping and prep work, so you can get out of the kitchen fast. Use a slow cooker liner in this recipe to make clean-up even easier. Top each taco with diced red onion, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Reynolds® Slow Cooker Liner</li>
                <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or mix of thighs and breasts</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided    </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon crushed black pepper, divided</li>   
                <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>1 jalapeno, cut in half and seeded</li>
                <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
                <li>2 medium limes, juiced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 small bunch cilantro, stems cut off and leaves coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>12 (6 inch) corn tortillas, warmed</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Line a 4-quart to 6-quart slow cooker with a Reynolds Slow Cooker Liner.</li>
                <li>Trim any large pieces of fat from chicken thighs. Season chicken with 1/2 of the salt and pepper; add to slow cooker.</li>
                <li>Add onion, garlic, jalapeño, orange juice, lime juice, soy sauce, cumin, and remaining salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir gently with a wooden or silicone spoon to combine.</li>
                <li>Cover and cook on Low for 4 to 5 hours or High for 2 to 3 hours, until chicken is done</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the lid to allow steam to escape. Use a slotted spoon to transfer chicken to a large bowl or cutting board. Shred into bite-sized chunks. Chicken should easily shred when it is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Ladle out some juice from the slow cooker, leaving enough to mix with shredded chicken.</li>
                <li>Spoon shredded chicken back into the lined slow cooker. Season to taste with additional salt, pepper, and cumin, if necessary.</li>
                <li>Serve in warmed tortillas with desired toppings.</li>
            </ol>
